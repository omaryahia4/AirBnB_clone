# AirBnB clone - The console


## Description :
HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.
## Console :
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application.
## Using the Console :
The HolbertonBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file `console.py` at the command line.


```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
```
Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the file `console.py` by itself:
 ```
$ ./console.py
```
While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:
  ```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
```
To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal (`ctrl-D`).
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```
